# hallrental

The Hall Rental project was realized for the Reemiland Family Play Centre. Application is no longer available and maintained. The application was developed in Java Web technologies (Spring, JPA etc.). Benefit of the created application is assisting clients and Reemiland's employees in hall rental process. In the past clients had to request hall rental exclusively at the time of working hours which was big inconvenience. Nowadays this action is accessible via the Internet. The employees have a look at all events (hall rentals), clients and costs that are stored in the database.
